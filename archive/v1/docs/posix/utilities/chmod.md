#### <span id="tag_20_17_01"></span>NAME

> chmod — change the file modes

#### <span id="tag_20_17_02"></span>SYNOPSIS

> `chmod`` `**`[`**`-R`**`]`**` `*`mode file`*`...`

#### <span id="tag_20_17_03"></span>DESCRIPTION

> The *chmod* utility shall change any or all of the file mode bits of the file named by each *file* operand in the way specified by the *mode* operand.
>
> It is implementation-defined whether and how the *chmod* utility affects any alternate or additional file access control mechanism (see XBD [*4.7 File Access Permissions*](../basedefs/V1_chap04.html#tag_04_07)) being used for the specified file.
>
> Only a process whose effective user ID matches the user ID of the file, or a process with appropriate privileges, shall be permitted to change the file mode bits of a file.
>
> Upon successfully changing the file mode bits of a file, the *chmod* utility shall mark for update the last file status change timestamp of the file.

#### <span id="tag_20_17_04"></span>OPTIONS

> The *chmod* utility shall conform to XBD [*12.2 Utility Syntax Guidelines*](../basedefs/V1_chap12.html#tag_12_02).
>
> The following option shall be supported:
>
> **-R**
>
> Recursively change file mode bits. For each *file* operand that names a directory, *chmod* shall change the file mode bits of the directory and all files in the file hierarchy below it.

#### <span id="tag_20_17_05"></span>OPERANDS

> The following operands shall be supported:
>
> *mode*

#### <span id="tag_20_17_13"></span>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

> The *mode* operand shall be either a *symbolic_mode* expression or a non-negative octal integer. The *symbolic_mode* form is described by the grammar later in this section.
>
> Each **clause** shall specify an operation to be performed on the current file mode bits of each *file*. The operations shall be performed on each *file* in the order in which the **clause**s are specified.
>
> The **who** symbols **u**, **g**, and **o** shall specify the *user*, *group*, and *other* parts of the file mode bits, respectively. A **who** consisting of the symbol **a** shall be equivalent to **ugo**.
>
> The **perm** symbols **r**, **w**, and **x** represent the *read*, *write*, and *execute*/*search* portions of file mode bits, respectively. The **perm** symbol **s** shall represent the *set-user-ID-on-execution* (when **who** contains or implies **u**) and *set-group-ID-on-execution* (when **who** contains or implies **g**) bits.
>
> The **perm** symbol **X** shall represent the execute/search portion of the file mode bits if the file is a directory or if the current (unmodified) file mode bits have at least one of the execute bits (S_IXUSR, S_IXGRP, or S_IXOTH) set. It shall be ignored if the file is not a directory and none of the execute bits are set in the current file mode bits.
>
> The **permcopy** symbols **u**, **g**, and **o** shall represent the current permissions associated with the user, group, and other parts of the file mode bits, respectively. For the remainder of this section, **perm** refers to the non-terminals **perm** and **permcopy** in the grammar.
>
> If multiple **actionlist**s are grouped with a single **wholist** in the grammar, each **actionlist** shall be applied in the order specified with that **wholist**. The *op* symbols shall represent the operation performed, as follows:
>
> `+`
>
> If **perm** is not specified, the `'+'` operation shall not change the file mode bits.
>
> If **who** is not specified, the file mode bits represented by **perm** for the owner, group, and other permissions, except for those with corresponding bits in the file mode creation mask of the invoking process, shall be set.
>
> Otherwise, the file mode bits represented by the specified **who** and **perm** values shall be set.
>
> `-`
>
> If **perm** is not specified, the `'-'` operation shall not change the file mode bits.
>
> If **who** is not specified, the file mode bits represented by **perm** for the owner, group, and other permissions, except for those with corresponding bits in the file mode creation mask of the invoking process, shall be cleared.
>
> Otherwise, the file mode bits represented by the specified **who** and **perm** values shall be cleared.
>
> `=`
>
> Clear the file mode bits specified by the **who** value, or, if no **who** value is specified, all of the file mode bits specified in this volume of POSIX.1-2024.
>
> If **perm** is not specified, the `'='` operation shall make no further modifications to the file mode bits.
>
> If **who** is not specified, the file mode bits represented by **perm** for the owner, group, and other permissions, except for those with corresponding bits in the file mode creation mask of the invoking process, shall be set.
>
> Otherwise, the file mode bits represented by the specified **who** and **perm** values shall be set.
>
> When using the symbolic mode form on a regular file, it is implementation-defined whether or not:
>
> - Requests to set the set-user-ID-on-execution or set-group-ID-on-execution bit when all execute bits are currently clear and none are being set are ignored.
>
> - Requests to clear all execute bits also clear the set-user-ID-on-execution and set-group-ID-on-execution bits.
>
> - Requests to clear the set-user-ID-on-execution or set-group-ID-on-execution bits when all execute bits are currently clear are ignored. However, if the command [*ls*](../utilities/ls.html) **-l** *file* writes an *s* in the position indicating that the set-user-ID-on-execution or set-group-ID-on-execution is set, the commands *chmod* **u-s** *file* or *chmod* **g-s** *file*, respectively, shall not be ignored.
>
> When using the symbolic mode form on other file types, it is implementation-defined whether or not requests to set or clear the set-user-ID-on-execution or set-group-ID-on-execution bits are honored.
>
> If the **who** symbol **o** is used in conjunction with the **perm** symbol **s** with no other **who** symbols being specified, the set-user-ID-on-execution and set-group-ID-on-execution bits shall not be modified. It shall not be an error to specify the **who** symbol **o** in conjunction with the **perm** symbol **s**.
>
> <sup>\[[XSI](javascript:open_code('XSI'))\]</sup> <img src="../images/opt-start.gif" data-border="0" alt="[Option Start]" /> The **perm** symbol **t** shall specify the S_ISVTX bit. When used with a file of type directory, it can be used with the **who** symbol **a**, or with no **who** symbol. It shall not be an error to specify a **who** symbol of **u**, **g**, or **o** in conjunction with the **perm** symbol **t**, but the meaning of these combinations is unspecified. The effect when using the **perm** symbol **t** with any file type other than directory is unspecified. <img src="../images/opt-end.gif" data-border="0" alt="[Option End]" />
>
> For an octal integer *mode* operand, the file mode bits shall be set absolutely.
>
> For each bit set in the octal number, the corresponding file permission bit shown in the following table shall be set; all other file permission bits shall be cleared. For regular files, for each bit set in the octal number corresponding to the set-user-ID-on-execution or the set-group-ID-on-execution, bits shown in the following table shall be set; if these bits are not set in the octal number, they are cleared. For other file types, it is implementation-defined whether or not requests to set or clear the set-user-ID-on-execution or set-group-ID-on-execution bits are honored.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="box">

*The following sections are informative.*

</div>

#### <span id="tag_20_17_16"></span>APPLICATION USAGE

> Some implementations of the *chmod* utility change the mode of a directory before the files in the directory when performing a recursive (**-R** option) change; others change the directory mode after the files in the directory. If an application tries to remove read or search permission for a file hierarchy, the removal attempt fails if the directory is changed first; on the other hand, trying to re-enable permissions to a restricted hierarchy fails if directories are changed last. Users should not try to make a hierarchy inaccessible to themselves.
>
> Some implementations of *chmod* never used the [*umask*](../utilities/umask.html) of the process when changing modes; systems conformant with this volume of POSIX.1-2024 do so when **who** is not specified. Note the difference between:
>
>
>     chmod a-w file
>
> which removes all write permissions, and:
>
>
>     chmod -- -w file
>
> which removes write permissions that would be allowed if **file** was created with the same [*umask*](../utilities/umask.html).
>
> Conforming applications should never assume that they know how the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits on directories are interpreted.

#### <span id="tag_20_17_17"></span>EXAMPLES

> | **Mode** | **Results** |
> |:---|:---|
> | *a*+= | Equivalent to *a*+,*a*=; clears all file mode bits. |
> | *go*+-w | Equivalent to *go*+,*go*-*w*; clears group and other write bits. |
> | *g*=*o*-*w* | Equivalent to *g*=*o*,*g*-*w*; sets group bit to match other bits and then clears group write bit. |
> | *g*-*r*+*w* | Equivalent to *g*-*r*,*g*+*w*; clears group read bit and sets group write bit. |
> | *uo*=*g* | Sets owner bits to match group bits and sets other bits to match group bits. |

#### <span id="tag_20_17_18"></span>RATIONALE

> The functionality of *chmod* is described substantially through references to concepts defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024. In this way, there is less duplication of effort required for describing the interactions of permissions. However, the behavior of this utility is not described in terms of the [*chmod*()](../functions/chmod.html) function from the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024 because that specification requires certain side-effects upon alternate file access control mechanisms that might not be appropriate, depending on the implementation.
>
> Implementations that support mandatory file and record locking as specified by the 1984 /usr/group standard historically used the combination of set-group-ID bit set and group execute bit clear to indicate mandatory locking. This condition is usually set or cleared with the symbolic mode **perm** symbol **l** instead of the **perm** symbols **s** and **x** so that the mandatory locking mode is not changed without explicit indication that that was what the user intended. Therefore, the details on how the implementation treats these conditions must be defined in the documentation. This volume of POSIX.1-2024 does not require mandatory locking (nor does the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024), but does allow it as an extension. However, this volume of POSIX.1-2024 does require that the [*ls*](../utilities/ls.html) and *chmod* utilities work consistently in this area. If [*ls*](../utilities/ls.html) **-l** *file* indicates that the set-group-ID bit is set, *chmod* **g-s** *file* must clear it (assuming appropriate privileges exist to change modes).
>
> The System V and BSD versions use different exit status codes. Some implementations used the exit status as a count of the number of errors that occurred; this practice is unworkable since it can overflow the range of valid exit status values. This problem is avoided here by specifying only 0 and \>0 as exit values.
>
> The System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1-2024 indicates that implementation-defined restrictions may cause the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits to be ignored. This volume of POSIX.1-2024 allows the *chmod* utility to choose to modify these bits before calling [*chmod*()](../functions/chmod.html) (or some function providing equivalent capabilities) for non-regular files. Among other things, this allows implementations that use the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits on directories to enable extended features to handle these extensions in an intelligent manner.
>
> The **X** **perm** symbol was adopted from BSD-based systems because it provides commonly desired functionality when doing recursive (**-R** option) modifications. Similar functionality is not provided by the [*find*](../utilities/find.html) utility. Historical BSD versions of *chmod*, however, only supported **X** with *op*+; it has been extended in this volume of POSIX.1-2024 because it is also useful with *op*=. (It has also been added for *op*- even though it duplicates **x**, in this case, because it is intuitive and easier to explain.)
>
> The grammar was extended with the *permcopy* non-terminal to allow historical-practice forms of symbolic modes like **o**=**u** **-g** (that is, set the "other" permissions to the permissions of "owner" minus the permissions of "group").
