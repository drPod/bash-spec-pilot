#### <span id="tag_20_46_02"></span>SYNOPSIS

> `file`` `**`[`**`-dh`**`] [`**`-M`` `*`file`***`] [`**`-m`` `*`file`***`]`**` `*`file`*`...`\

#### <span id="tag_20_46_03"></span>DESCRIPTION

> The *file* utility shall perform a series of tests in sequence on each specified *file* in an attempt to classify it:
>
> 1.  If *file* does not exist, cannot be read, or its file status could not be determined, the output shall indicate that the file was processed, but that its type could not be determined.
>
> 2.  If the file is not a regular file, its file type shall be identified. The file types directory, FIFO, socket, block special, and character special shall be identified as such. Other implementation-defined file types may also be identified. If *file* is a symbolic link, by default the link shall be resolved and *file* shall test the type of file referenced by the symbolic link. (See the **-h** and **-i** options below.)
>
> 3.  If the length of *file* is zero, it shall be identified as an empty file.
>
> 4.  The *file* utility shall examine an initial segment of *file* and shall make a guess at identifying its contents based on position-sensitive tests. (The answer is not guaranteed to be correct; see the **-d**, **-M**, and **-m** options below.)
>
> 5.  The *file* utility shall examine *file* and make a guess at identifying its contents based on context-sensitive default system tests. (The answer is not guaranteed to be correct.)
>
> 6.  The file shall be identified as a data file.
>
> If *file* does not exist, cannot be read, or its file status could not be determined, the output shall indicate that the file was processed, but that its type could not be determined.
>
> If *file* is a symbolic link, by default the link shall be resolved and *file* shall test the type of file referenced by the symbolic link.

#### <span id="tag_20_46_04"></span>OPTIONS

> The *file* utility shall conform to XBD [*12.2 Utility Syntax Guidelines*](../basedefs/V1_chap12.html#tag_12_02), except that the order of the **-m**, **-d**, and **-M** options shall be significant.
>
> The following options shall be supported by the implementation:
>
> **-d**
>
> Apply any position-sensitive default system tests and context-sensitive default system tests to the file. This is the default if no **-M** or **-m** option is specified.
>
> **-h**
>
> When a symbolic link is encountered, identify the file as a symbolic link. If **-h** is not specified and *file* is a symbolic link that refers to a nonexistent file, *file* shall identify the file as a symbolic link, as if **-h** had been specified.
>
> **-i**
>
> If a file is a regular file, do not attempt to classify the type of the file further, but identify the file as specified in the STDOUT section.
>
> **-M ***file*
>
> Specify the name of a file containing position-sensitive tests that shall be applied to a file in order to classify it (see the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION). No position-sensitive default system tests nor context-sensitive default system tests shall be applied unless the **-d** option is also specified.
>
> **-m ***file*
>
> Specify the name of a file containing position-sensitive tests that shall be applied to a file in order to classify it (see the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION).
>
> If the **-m** option is specified without specifying the **-d** option or the **-M** option, position-sensitive default system tests shall be applied after the position-sensitive tests specified by the **-m** option. If the **-M** option is specified with the **-d** option, the **-m** option, or both, or the **-m** option is specified with the **-d** option, the concatenation of the position-sensitive tests specified by these options shall be applied in the order specified by the appearance of these options. If a **-M** or **-m** *file* option-argument is **-**, the results are unspecified.

#### <span id="tag_20_46_13"></span>EXTENDED DESCRIPTION

> A file specified as an option-argument to the **-m** or **-M** options shall contain one position-sensitive test per line, which shall be applied to the file. If the test succeeds, the message field of the line shall be printed and no further tests shall be applied, with the exception that tests on immediately following lines beginning with a single `'>'` character shall be applied.
>
> Each line shall be composed of the following four \<tab\>-separated fields. (Implementations may allow any combination of one or more white-space characters other than \<newline\> to act as field separators.)
>
> *offset*
>
> An unsigned number (optionally preceded by a single `'>'` character) specifying the *offset*, in bytes, of the value in the file that is to be compared against the *value* field of the line. If the file is shorter than the specified offset, the test shall fail.
>
> If the *offset* begins with the character `'>'`, the test contained in the line shall not be applied to the file unless the test on the last line for which the *offset* did not begin with a `'>'` was successful. By default, the *offset* shall be interpreted as an unsigned decimal number. With a leading 0x or 0X, the *offset* shall be interpreted as a hexadecimal number; otherwise, with a leading 0, the *offset* shall be interpreted as an octal number.
>
> *type*
>
> The type of the value in the file to be tested. The type shall consist of the type specification characters `d`, `s`, and `u`, specifying signed decimal, string, and unsigned decimal, respectively.
>
> The *type* string shall be interpreted as the bytes from the file starting at the specified *offset* and including the same number of bytes specified by the *value* field. If insufficient bytes remain in the file past the *offset* to match the *value* field, the test shall fail.
>
> The type specification characters `d` and `u` can be followed by an optional unsigned decimal integer that specifies the number of bytes represented by the type. The type specification characters `d` and `u` can be followed by an optional `C`, `S`, `I`, or `L`, indicating that the value is of type **char**, **short**, **int**, or **long**, respectively.
>
> The default number of bytes represented by the type specifiers `d`, `f`, and `u` shall correspond to their respective C-language types as follows. If the system claims conformance to the C-Language Development Utilities option, those specifiers shall correspond to the default sizes used in the [*c17*](../utilities/c17.html) utility. Otherwise, the default sizes shall be implementation-defined.
>
> For the type specifier characters `d` and `u`, the default number of bytes shall correspond to the size of a basic integer type of the implementation. For these specifier characters, the implementation shall support values of the optional number of bytes to be converted corresponding to the number of bytes in the C-language types **char**, **short**, **int**, or **long**. These numbers can also be specified by an application as the characters `C`, `S`, `I`, and `L`, respectively. The byte order used when interpreting numeric values is implementation-defined, but shall correspond to the order in which a constant of the corresponding type is stored in memory on the system.
>
> All type specifiers, except for `s`, can be followed by a mask specifier of the form &*number*. The mask value shall be AND'ed with the value of the input file before the comparison with the *value* field of the line is made. By default, the mask shall be interpreted as an unsigned decimal number. With a leading 0x or 0X, the mask shall be interpreted as an unsigned hexadecimal number; otherwise, with a leading 0, the mask shall be interpreted as an unsigned octal number.
>
> The strings **byte**, **short**, **long**, and **string** shall also be supported as type fields, being interpreted as `dC`, `dS`, `dL`, and `s`, respectively.
>
> *value*
>
> The *value* to be compared with the value from the file.
>
> If the specifier from the type field is `s` or **string**, then interpret the value as a string. Otherwise, interpret it as a number. If the value is a string, then the test shall succeed only when a string value exactly matches the bytes from the file.
>
> If the *value* is a string, it can contain the following sequences:
>
> \\*character*
>
> The \<backslash\>-escape sequences as specified in XBD [*Escape Sequences and Associated Actions*](../basedefs/V1_chap05.html#tagtcjh_2) (`'\\'`, `'\a'`, `'\b'`, `'\f'`, `'\n'`, `'\r'`, `'\t'`, `'\v'`). In addition, the escape sequence `'\ '` (the \<backslash\> character followed by a \<space\> character) shall be recognized to represent a \<space\> character. The results of using any other character, other than an octal digit, following the \<backslash\> are unspecified.
>
> \\*octal*
>
> Octal sequences that can be used to represent characters with specific coded values. An octal sequence shall consist of a \<backslash\> followed by the longest sequence of one, two, or three octal-digit characters (01234567).
>
> By default, any value that is not a string shall be interpreted as a signed decimal number. Any such value, with a leading 0x or 0X, shall be interpreted as an unsigned hexadecimal number; otherwise, with a leading zero, the value shall be interpreted as an unsigned octal number.
>
> If the value is not a string, it can be preceded by a character indicating the comparison to be performed. Permissible characters and the comparisons they specify are as follows:
>
> `=`
>
> The test shall succeed if the value from the file equals the *value* field.
>
> `<`
>
> The test shall succeed if the value from the file is less than the *value* field.
>
> `>`
>
> The test shall succeed if the value from the file is greater than the *value* field.
>
> `&`
>
> The test shall succeed if all of the set bits in the *value* field are set in the value from the file.
>
> `^`
>
> The test shall succeed if at least one of the set bits in the *value* field is not set in the value from the file.
>
> `x`
>
> The test shall succeed if the file is large enough to contain a value of the type specified starting at the offset specified.
>
> *message*
>
> The *message* to be printed if the test succeeds. The *message* shall be interpreted using the notation for the [*printf*](../utilities/printf.html) formatting specification; see [*printf*](../utilities/printf.html). If the *value* field was a string, then the value from the file shall be the argument for the [*printf*](../utilities/printf.html) formatting specification; otherwise, the value from the file shall be the argument.

<div class="box">

*The following sections are informative.*

</div>

#### <span id="tag_20_46_16"></span>APPLICATION USAGE

> The *file* utility can only be required to guess at many of the file types because only exhaustive testing can determine some types with certainty. For example, binary data on some implementations might match the initial segment of an executable or a *tar* archive.
>
> Note that the table indicates that the output contains the stated string. Systems may add text before or after the string. For executables, as an example, the machine architecture and various facts about how the file was link-edited may be included. Note also that on systems that recognize shell script files starting with `"#!"` as executable files, these may be identified as executable binary files rather than as shell scripts.

#### <span id="tag_20_46_17"></span>EXAMPLES

> Determine whether an argument is a binary executable file:
>
>
>     file -- "$1" | grep -q ':.*executable' &&
>         printf "%s is executable.\n" "$1"

#### <span id="tag_20_46_18"></span>RATIONALE

> The **-f** option was omitted because the same effect can (and should) be obtained using the [*xargs*](../utilities/xargs.html) utility.
>
> Historical versions of the *file* utility attempt to identify the following types of files: symbolic link, directory, character special, block special, socket, *tar* archive, *cpio* archive, SCCS archive, archive library, empty, [*compress*](../utilities/compress.html) output, *pack* output, binary data, C source, FORTRAN source, assembler source, *nroff*/*troff*/*eqn*/*tbl* source *troff* output, shell script, C shell script, English text, ASCII text, various executables, APL workspace, compiled terminfo entries, and CURSES screen images. Only those types that are reasonably well specified in POSIX or are directly related to POSIX utilities are listed in the table.
>
> Historical systems have used a "magic file" named **/etc/magic** to help identify file types. Because it is generally useful for users and scripts to be able to identify special file types, the **-m** flag and a portable format for user-created magic files has been specified. No requirement is made that an implementation of *file* use this method of identifying files, only that users be permitted to add their own classifying tests.
>
> In addition, three options have been added to historical practice. The **-d** flag has been added to permit users to cause their tests to follow any default system tests. The **-i** flag has been added to permit users to test portably for regular files in shell scripts. The **-M** flag has been added to permit users to ignore any default system tests.
>
> The POSIX.1-2024 description of default system tests and the interaction between the **-d**, **-M**, and **-m** options did not clearly indicate that there were two types of "default system tests". The "position-sensitive tests" determine file types by looking for certain string or binary values at specific offsets in the file being examined. These position-sensitive tests were implemented in historical systems using the magic file described above. Some of these tests are now built into the *file* utility itself on some implementations so the output can provide more detail than can be provided by magic files. For example, a magic file can easily identify a file containing a core image on most implementations, but cannot name the program file that dropped the core. A magic file could produce output such as:
>
>
>     /home/dwc/core: ELF 32-bit MSB core file SPARC Version 1
>
> but by building the test into the *file* utility, you could get output such as:
>
>
>     /home/dwc/core: ELF 32-bit MSB core file SPARC Version 1, from 'testprog'
>
> These extended built-in tests are still to be treated as position-sensitive default system tests even if they are not listed in **/etc/magic** or any other magic file.
>
> The context-sensitive default system tests were always built into the *file* utility. These tests looked for language constructs in text files trying to identify shell scripts, C, FORTRAN, and other computer language source files, and even plain text files. With the addition of the **-m** and **-M** options the distinction between position-sensitive and context-sensitive default system tests became important because the order of testing is important. The context-sensitive system default tests should never be applied before any position-sensitive tests even if the **-d** option is specified before a **-m** option or **-M** option due to the high probability that the context-sensitive system default tests will incorrectly identify arbitrary text files as text files before position-sensitive tests specified by the **-m** or **-M** option would be applied to give a more accurate identification.
>
> Leaving the meaning of **-M -** and **-m -** unspecified allows an existing prototype of these options to continue to work in a backwards-compatible manner. (In that implementation, **-M -** was roughly equivalent to **-d** in POSIX.1-2024.)
>
> The historical **-c** option was omitted as not particularly useful to users or portable shell scripts. In addition, a reasonable implementation of the *file* utility would report any errors found each time the magic file is read.
>
> The historical format of the magic file was the same as that specified by the Rationale in the ISO POSIX-2:1993 standard for the *offset*, *value*, and *message* fields; however, it used less precise type fields than the format specified by the current normative text. The new type field values are a superset of the historical ones.

> If this utility is directed to display a pathname that contains any bytes that have the encoded value of a \<newline\> character when \<newline\> is a terminator or separator in the output format being used, implementations are encouraged to treat this as an error.
